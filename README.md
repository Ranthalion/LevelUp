## Getting Started

Built with Laravel which requires the following
- PHP 5.6 or higher (installing on windows requires editing the php.ini file)
- Composer  
- Vagrant  
- VirtualBox (or other VM software)
- ssh keys must be set up as configured in Homestead.yaml

(I'm also using ConEmu as a commmand line shell in Windows 8)
